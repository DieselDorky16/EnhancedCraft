**EnhancedCraft** is a **Minecraft mod** that adds **about 15 new biomes** to the Overworld, adds a new, secret dimension known as the Angelwood Lands, and adds a variety of new ores and blocks. Here is what's available to you:

**_Blocks_**
* Added New Soul Variants of various light-emitting blocks
* Added a new type of stone known as Soulstone, and can be found naturally in the Nether at any height
* Added a new color for some blocks
* New Wood Type: Angel Wood - Can be found in the secret dimension. In other words, it's only available in Creative Mode.
* Soul Sponges! Remove lava quickly by using the Soul Sponge. Just don't place charred ones in the Overworld. Otherwise, they will get cold...
* Added Polished Bricks of Andesite Diorite, and Granite
* Added Brick Variants of Sandstone and Red Sandstone
* Added Glazed Soulstone

**_Items_**
* A new item tier is added: It's Platinum. Stronger than Diamond, but weaker than Netherite. Can be found deep underground in the Overworld.
* Added new leather types for each entity that drops upon death.
    * Mooshrooms drop leather based on their color upon death. Therefore, if a brown mooshroom dies, it drops Brown Mooshroom Leather. Otherwise, the red mooshroom would drop the red variant. It's extremely complicated loot table logic...
* Added new foods: Platinum and Soul Apples. Don't eat the souls though, or good luck surviving...

**_Potions_**
* Added Potion of Decay
* Added more vanilla potions!

**_Biomes_**
* Added Snowy Variants of some of the vanilla biomes
